Don't make technology decisions alone

Need a CTO? A technical expert backing you up?

üëã I help founders and early stage startups with technology



## About

I'm √òyvind. I'm based in Oslo, Norway. Between 2012 and 2024 I programmed backend systems for 11 startups and scaleups. 

Now I use my technical and product development skills to help founders and early-stage startups as an advisor and Fractional CTO. 

I Answer technical questions, help plan and set strategy, avoid common mistakes and help you find the right developers and agencies. I'm also "in your corner" when you're buying and dealing with suppliers.  

üá≥üá¥ Det meste av innholdet p√• denne nettsiden er p√• engelsk. Men jeg vurdere √• begynne √• skrive mer p√• norsk. Send meg en melding her eller p√• LinkedIn hvis det er noe du gjerne vil lese om p√• norsk.  

## Who is this for? // how I can help

>So stop trying to ‚Äúsell.‚Äù Start telling the truth about the problems you‚Äôve seen.


Are you a founder in the early stages? Or maybe you have an idea you want to ..

Do any of these ring true:
Do you ever feel confused about tech?
Do you ever feel confused about what you need to make?
and how to go about making it? Where to start?
Do you ever wish you had someone to ask about tech stuff?
Someone who fought for you?
Someone who could dive into technical problems and figure shit out?
Do you ever feel stuck?
Do you ever doubt how to best spend your money?
Do you find it hard to separate vendors bullshit from reality?
Someone to help you vet potential hires, agencies and consultants? 

I can help you with technology and taking your vision and making it a reality. 

My customers are driven and serious. They are either alone in their mission or have a small team. They are smart and capable, but feel they are lacking some sort of technical expertise on their team. 

Most want to, or are in the process of creating, some sort of new, digital product:
A app, a platform, a website or web app .. or something else. Or they have a clear vision, but they don't yet know how that translates into technology and products. 

### Are you creating something new?
#### In the idea or planning fase

Before the product development is started:
- Get the idea and vision out of your head and down "on paper" (plans, rough sketches)
- De-risk: Structure the Product Development in a way that minimize risk
- Guide technology choices early on
- How much will it cost? How hard is it to make? Is it a 10 000$ thing or a 1 million $ thing? 
- Can minor changes make it quicker and cheaper to make? 
- Should you build something custom? or buy on an existing product? A combination? 
- Creating a technical road-map
- Finding and Evaluating technical partners: Agencies, Contractors and Freelancers
- Help with negotiating and evaluating their offers

#### During development

During the product development:
- Continually following up the process: Is it on track? Are they doing the right things? 
- Evaluate and test results from development
- Find answers to technical questions and blockers

#### After initial development
- Finding and evaluating partners and employees to keep everything running smoothly, securely and at low cost
- Documentation and knowledge transfer

### Other services

In addition to helping create new apps and platforms, I can help founders and startups with other technical challanges:

- Fill in for a CTO
- Evaluate the technical skills of new hires, agencies and freelancers.  
- Evaluate the curen status quoe. What's the ..
- Assist investors with technical evaluation and due dilligence
- Diagnose and solve technical problems
- Highlite potential improvements and automations. 
- Explore use-cases for AI 

- Someone with ‚Äúbuying skills‚Äù, who can:
   - Evaluate suppliers, partners and candidates
   - Create a process that minimizes risk
   - Continuously follow up on ongoing development

- Stand in for a tech founder
- Be the missing technical person on the founding team.
- Hire the initial team
- Source, interview, and organize the initial engineering team.
- Quickly scale a team
- Hire the first full time CTO
- After one or more key people depart, stand in and keep the wheels from falling off, while filling the missing roles.
- Provide a product vision
	- This will happen if there is no product leader, and the fCTO is expected to look after the whole product and engineering organization.
- Fix a problem
	- It could be a technical, operational, or managerial problem that someone at the company identified but needs a more experienced person to solve.
- Technical advisor
	- Bring your experience to advise on big technical decisions.
- Build a process
	- This could be a single process, or shoring up operational excellence on a team.
	- Examples: hiring process, system monitoring and on-call process, git branching and deployment
- Bring observability
	- Implement people or system metrics, and guide the team on how to use them effectively.

## Services and prices

I run workshops and provide continuous support for startup founders.

 instead of spending $100k+ only to find a show stopper (can't fully control the expereince of my App with the selected no-code tech), let's allocate 10-15% of that to make sure we're doing the right thing.

Continues advice:
Prices depend on my involvement and responsibility.

I wonder if it could help to add in your service description that after doing your workshop, they are able to better target/headhunt¬† their ideal CTO / or tech guy.

Because I specialize in helping founders and small startups (1-10 people) I have  seen many of the challenges you face before. I've also seen the common mistakes startups make

and I can help to surface the *unknown unknowns*.

At least we can avoid the most common mistakes

I can't help you navigate the politics of a large organization. And I know nothing about how to mange large groups of people, or how to structure development work across thousands of developers.

I do know how you can make things fast and use your speed and agility as strenghts.

### Case studies, previos clients and work

- Produktuvikling g√•r skeis
	- De leverer ikke, stopper halvveis
	- Det blir for dyrt
	- De deler ikke kode og dokumentasjon
	- De leverer ikke kvalitet
	- De tar ikke riktige snarveier, ting g√•r for seint
	- Eller g√•r det bra? Hva kan man forvente? Gj√∏r de en god jobb? 
- Forvirring rundt hvor man skal begynne
- Forvirring rundt hvem man skal leie
- Forvirring rundt konkrete terminologi, teknologi etc 
- Vet ikke hva som er mulig med AI o.l.

## FAQ

### What is a "Fractional CTO?" 

### Why not just hire a CTO?

### How long are typical engagements? 

### Do you also do hands-on programming work?
Usually not, since it's important for me to be objective when recommending freelancers, consultants and agencies. Also, my rates as a devloper are high, so there are probably better options. 

I still enjoy programming though, but nowadays it's mostly on my own projects (such as the CMS for this website). 

### Why is it so cheap?
Mostly because I just started doing this this year. My goal is to raise my prices soon =)

### Will you work for equity?

"I'm not an investor. I don't have the time or the skills to evaluate your idea, the market, the competition etc etc.  What *I can* do is help you get your MVP built, answer your technical questions and figure out how to deal with all your current technical challenges (or whatever).  *And* I can start helping right away. But equity would complicate things a lot, and I would have to take time to figure out the legalities, do due diligence and market analysis.  I would much rather get to work doing x,y and z."  ... 

"Also, my involvement is temporary. My goal is to help you succeed and get to the point where you can, and need to, hire a full-time CTO. Therefore, having me in the CAP table will create some problems, as it will last long after my involvement.
