(100% Typo Guarantee - This post was not generated with AI. It was hand-crafted and published unfiltered)

Let's say you are a non-technical founders making something digital. You got some funding and you want to spend the money well. 

What are the most common mistakes to avoid? Here are 11:

In short, some common failures are:
- Spending all your money on the Product
- Building when you can buy
- Worrying too much about technology choices
- Having absolutely no idea on what you need to create
- Totally ignoring generative AI (or trusting it too much)
- Spending all your money on the first version
- Not breaking the work into phases
- Not looking for the right things when hiring employees, contractors or agencies
- Blindly using “best practices” instead of taking the shortcuts available to startups
- Making it complicated
- Not keeping the project on track

# "Product development", what is that exactly? 

"Product development" is making the product. Either a new one from scratch or improving on an existing one.

The "product" is whatever you need to fulfill your vision. I could be an app, or a chair, or a new type of perfume.

I'm mostly concerned with creating *new*, *digital* products.

People do create new physical product, but even then there's usually a digital component. If there's nothing digital, the rest of this is might not be very useful to you  :)



# Mistake 1: Spending all your money on the Product 
Remember that you probably have to to marketing, customer research, sales etc. So don't spend all your time and money on the making the product.

How much to spend? It depends, unfortunately, but ask yourselves questions like:

- How good does this MVP / first version of the product have to be?  
- How convinced are you that you know what to make? It's usually a good idea to do customer validation, but some people have a very strong vision.  
- What kind of marketing will be necessary? Sales? What does it cost?  
- How important is the actual product compared to marketing and sales?


# Mistake 2:  Building when you can buy

Are you absolutely sure you have to build something new from scratch? Or are there faster and cheaper ways?

For example:

- For an MVP the main goal is to learn. Are there other ways to learn?  
- Can you buy or license one or more products and connect them? Think: existing services \+ Zappier or *some* custom development to tie it all together.

Are there platforms or white-labeled products specialized in what you want to do? Examples are:

- You probably wouldn't create your own webshop, there's Shopify and many competitors. Even free and open source.  
- Creating a marketplace? Check out Sharetribe first  
- A course or similar? Maybe LearnWorlds or Zoonk works?  
- Membership site or community? Test Outseta and others.  
- Etc etc. At least have a look, you might be surprised.

It won't be a perfect solution. But it can be good enough to learn and get you to "the next level". This should be fast and cheap to try out, and therefor you can always build a custom solution later.


# Mistake 3: Worrying too much about technology choices 

While technology choices  can *sometimes* be very important, they are usually not. Usually it's much more important to find great people, use a good process and follow up on the work.

There are exceptions of course, like when one specific technology give a huge edge or is more or less mandated by other circumstances.

Generative AI might just be such a technology that gives you a "huge edge".  Especially in the early prototype / MVP phase. More on that later.     

In general, find good people and let them use whatever technologies they know (do not pay for contractors to learn a new programming language). Favor technologies that let you move fast and be flexible.


# Mistake 4: Having absolutely no idea on what you need to create

A mobile app? A web app? Some sort of platform? A website?

This can be hard to answer early on, when there's a lot of uncertainty. But having *some* idea will help you when you talk to developers and designers. Also, an agency will push their *favourite thing* made with their *favourite technology*, so you should have some direction before you buy anything.

Ponder who will use it, when and where.

When in doubt, **go for the quickest, cheapest and most flexible option**. Use that to learn from early users and hone the product. You can always convert (or in the worst case, re-create it) later using the less flexible, "slower" technology.

Mobile Apps that have to go through the Apple or Google (Android) app stores are slower to update and often harder to make than web apps.

## Examples of digital products

**Mobile apps:** Such as Spotify and Google Maps on your phone.

**Websites:** Static, read-only pages. They look and behave the same for everyone. Think Wikipedia, the way most people use it.

**Web apps:** Basically more advanced websites that do more than give all visitors the same information. Think Google Maps or Gmail on your computer. Or Wikipedia they way it actually works: You can log in, change articles and add new ones.

**Computer Programs:** Unlike web apps these are the programs you would have to install. Think Word and Excel before Microsoft turned them into web apps.

These are pretty uncommon these days, for better or worse. Web apps, where there's nothing to install and update, have taken over.

**Platforms:** A general term that means different things to different people. Usually something kind-of-hidden that ties everything together.

**Behind the scenes automation:** Automation that are mostly hidden from the user. When *this* happens over here, *some thing* else happens over there.

Often related to creating processes in the business.

Modern e-commerce is filled with automation: When the customer buys something the payment is automatically processed and emails and products are automatically sent out. Other sectors often have a lot more they could automate.


# Mistake 5: Totally ignoring generative AI (or expecting too much from it)

While generative AI might be over-hyped, it's definitely changing things. Especially in the early prototype phase, where you can now do more yourselves without developers and designers. So don't totally ignore them! Play around with for example *v0* , *Databutton* (Norwegian!) or Lovable (haven't tried it : ) . Just don't spend three months agonizing over which one you should use.

Also, tools like *v0* , *Databutton* and  *Lovable* feels like magic, especially in the beginning. But be prepared for *hitting the wall*  at some point. I don't believe most apps can be build *exclusively* with these tools without any coding or understanding of programming. 

Generally, I see two approaches to using gen AI at the moment:

1\)  Using something like v0 or Databutton and try to generate your product completely, basically just by prompting.. This is a top-down approach, since the tool sits at the top and "owns" or "controls" everything. 

This can work for simple things, and it's worth spending a few days just trying to get them to to what you want. But, if you have spent weeks or months, and not making any progress, it might be time to move on. 

Fortunately, many tools now let you export the underlying code. So even if they don't get you all the way, maybe you can take what the created and build on it. Or maybe not. It might be so bad it's better to throw it away and start fresh. And that's okay as well, as long as you didn't spend too much time or money on it.

2\) Use AI tools tools as a part of the product development process. This can speed things up and help you do things  to speed it up. Tools like *Copilot* and *Cursor* for programming, and *UiZard* or *v0* to generate design and UX. 

This is a little harder to get started, as you need to know more about the standard product development process. You also need to know more tools. 

However, it gives you a lot more control and a lot more flexibility: You're not limited to what one tool can create.  Also you can mix-and-match AI created and "manually" created stuff.



# Mistake 6: Spending all your money on the first version

You will learn *a lot* building your first version or an MVP. Ideally, you will have time and money left to use what you learn and update the product.

Here's what *not to do*:

- Make a huge list of all the features you think your users will want  
- Shop this around and get quotes from freelancers and agencies on how much it will cost (These are non-binding, by the way, so they ~~can be~~ will be waaaaay off).  
- Give all your money to whoever you like best  
- Sit and wait for 6-18 months while you hope for the best

Instead embrace the *Build \-\> Measure \-\> Learn* cycle. Get them to build what you think is the most important feature. Or maybe the most risky one. And then test this with potential users.

Which segways neatly into:

# Mistake 7: Not breaking the work into phases (smaller pieces)

Break the product into phases. Each phase should complete something that you can see and try out.

This has two purposes:

1. Making sure the people can deliver something of value. You could be excused for thinking that was a given, but it's **surprisingly** common that projects end up without anything actually useful.  
2. You want the learning sooner rather than later. And you want to be able to use what you learn in the next phase.

Quick note regarding *1\.* : Projects taking longer than expected is extremely common. Predicting development work, for example, is very hard and has a lot uncertainty. The more novel what you're trying to do is, the more uncertainty. So you have to try to figure out if there are good reasons for any delays. This is easier when the project is split into smaller pieces.

# Mistake 8: Not looking for the right things when hiring employees, contractors or agencies

Find people with:

- A Get-shit-done attitude  
- Experience from small environments, where they had to take responsibility, be flexible and "wear many hats".  
- Want to work with you. As in: you are close to their ideal client, not just someone they take on because they need the money. 
	- As a small client, be weary of larger firms that prioritize their large clients (i.e. not you).  
- Have experience with relevant technologies, although *relevant* can be pretty broad. Just don't pay contractors by the hour to learn new technologies.

Also, be ware that if you buy from an agency they can swap out the people working on your product at any time. Unless the contract says otherwise. It's common practice to sell you on their best, most senior people and then swap them out in the middle of the project.

Paying a hourly or daily rate is the most common. Fixed or Value base pricing can be great for you as a buyer if you  1\) can break the work up into pieces that are predictable enough, or 2\) have a clear and measurable goal and you care less about how it's achieved (value based pricing).

Different models have different  incentives.

# Mistake 9: Blindly using “best practices” instead of taking the shortcuts available to startups

As a startup you have many things going against you, *but* you also have many advantages. Make sure you make use of them.

One such advantage is the flexibility you have because you're small and starting fresh.

"Best practices" is really: "What everyone else is doing". And "everyone else" are typically larger, well known companies, since they are often the ones people know and admire.

And as a startup, you *can not do the same* as "everyone else".

Therefore don't blindly copy what others have done. Maybe it made sense for them, but their circumstances could be very different from yours. This goes double for copying from large organizations.

So embrace being small. Take all the shortcuts available to you. You have no or few existing customers and less of a reputation to lose. Don't bog yourself down needlessly.

Obviously we can learn from others. Just don't copy without understanding.


# Mistake 10: Making it complicated

Most of use have a strong temptation to over-complicate things. It makes the work more interesting for designer and developers, and it gives the founders a sense of doing something important.

But making things complicated has many nasty side-effects. It makes change harder, and speed of change is one of the mort important things for a startup.

Unfortunately, "*taking shortcuts*" and "*keeping it simple*" can be at odds: The simple elegant solution might be better in the long run, while the complicated solution is faster to get up and running.  For example can using existing code and solutions be quick, while programming something custom from scratch result in a leaner, simpler system.

Still, try to simplify:

- The product: Fewer features  
- The technical inner workings: Less code, fewer moving parts  
- The company and processes:  Do you really need.. ? Is the drawback of adding *more stuff* worth it?

Identifying things you *don't have to do* is win-win because it makes your product both simpler (less intermingled fluff) and faster to develop (fewer things to make).


# Mistake 11: Not keeping the project on track

When the product is being made you have to keep tabs on the process:

- What is going on? What are they making? Does it make sense?  
- Do they have any questions for you? Did they misunderstand anything?  
- Are they prioritizing correctly?  
- Are they producing results you can see and test? Or are they having planning meetings to plan the next planning session?  
- Try what they make. Anything you can learn from it? Anything you can test with potential customers?

Of course you should not over-do this. Do not nit-pick every small decision, feature and color. Remember that this is not the complete, final version, just *a version*, a  step in the right direction.

So, on the one hand, don't just lob money over the wall and trust that everything is going to be great. You should have insight into the process and what is being done. After all, you are paying for it.  On the other hand, give people room to work. Good makers hate being micromanaged and should be able to make progress on their own.
