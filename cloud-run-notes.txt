Other:

Datastore works (but is it slower than AE?)


Build docker images locally or with Cloud Build?
Have a layered approch so we don't fetch modules every time (build goes from ~30 sec to >2 min)
Put docker images in gcr? Or some other place?
Does it have to be a docker image or must it simply comply to whatever standard?
Is vendor/ faster than go modules?  

Build Docker image locally (or with a CI server) vs using Google Cloud Build  


Converting:

check that all needed things are availible
 - memcache
 - memorystore
 - legacy yae stuff like tasks etc etc etc

package names
init() -> main()

switch appengine packages to cloud.google.com/go/..

Datastore:
Indexing is the default now (when?), so we have to tell ds not to index the fields that are too long (or just uneccessary)
	Foo []byte `datastore:",noindex"`
