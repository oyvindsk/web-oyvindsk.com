## About
Simple go blog that serves http://oyvindsk.com and its alias http://odots.org/

It reads posts and pages on startup, executes the templates and stores the resulting html in memory.
The blogposts are also go templates, to have a little more freedome. Might be a bad idea.

The static files are alos read into ram and served from there. Might also be a bad idea.

I'm still learning and this code is still a mess ..

## Todo
Too much to list =/

## Lisence
Go code (*.go files) are MIT / BSD 2-clause. Files in the static directory have their own licenses, see the files themselves. The css files in static/ have an unknown license, but was pretty much copied from http://www.alexedwards.net/.
