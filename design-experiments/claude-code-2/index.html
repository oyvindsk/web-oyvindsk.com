                <p>I'm Øyvind. I'm based in Oslo, Norway. Between 2012 and 2024 I programmed backend systems for 11 startups and scaleups.</p>
                <p>Now I use my technical and product development skills to help founders and early-stage startups as an advisor and Fractional CTO.</p>
                <p>I Answer technical questions, help plan and set strategy, avoid common mistakes and help you find the right developers and agencies. I'm also "in your corner" when you're buying and dealing with suppliers.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>So stop trying to "sell." Start telling the truth about the problems you've seen.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Are you a founder in the early stages? Or maybe you have an idea you want to...</p>

                <h3>Do any of these ring true:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do you ever feel confused about tech?</li>
                    <li>Do you ever feel confused about what you need to make?</li>
                    <li>and how to go about making it? Where to start?</li>
                    <li>Do you ever wish you had someone to ask about tech stuff?</li>
                    <li>Someone who fought for you?</li>
                    <li>Someone who could dive into technical problems and figure shit out?</li>
                    <li>Do you ever feel stuck?</li>
                    <li>Do you ever doubt how to best spend your money?</li>
                    <li>Do you find it hard to separate vendors bullshit from reality?</li>
                    <li>Someone to help you vet potential hires, agencies and consultants?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I can help you with technology and taking your vision and making it a reality.</p>

                <p>My customers are driven and serious. They are either alone in their mission or have a small team. They are smart and capable, but feel they are lacking some sort of technical expertise on their team.</p>

                <p>Most want to, or are in the process of creating, some sort of new, digital product: A app, a platform, a website or web app .. or something else. Or they have a clear vision, but they don't yet know how that translates into technology and products.</p>

                <h3>Are you creating something new?</h3>

                <div class="service-phases">
                    <h4>In the idea or planning fase</h4>
                    <p>Before the product development is started:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Get the idea and vision out of your head and down "on paper" (plans, rough sketches)</li>
                        <li>De-risk: Structure the Product Development in a way that minimize risk</li>
                        <li>Guide technology choices early on</li>
                        <li>How much will it cost? How hard is it to make? Is it a 10 000$ thing or a 1 million $ thing?</li>
                        <li>Can minor changes make it quicker and cheaper to make?</li>
                        <li>Should you build something custom? or buy on an existing product? A combination?</li>
                        <li>Creating a technical road-map</li>
                        <li>Finding and Evaluating technical partners: Agencies, Contractors and Freelancers</li>

                    <h4>During development</h4>
                    <p>During the product development:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Continually following up the process: Is it on track? Are they doing the right things?</li>

                        <li>Find answers to technical questions and blockers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>After initial development</h4>

                    <p>More than a mentor, consultant, or coach, I serve as an ally on your journey.</p>

                </blockquote>

                <p>Because I specialize in helping founders and small startups (1-10 people) I have seen many of the challenges you face before. I've also seen the common mistakes startups make and I can help to surface the <em>unknown unknowns</em>.</p>

                <p>At least we can avoid the most common mistakes.</p>

                <p>I can't help you navigate the politics of a large organization. And I know nothing about how to manage large groups of people, or how to structure development work across thousands of developers.</p>

                <p>I do know how you can make things fast and use your speed and agility as strengths.</p>
