<p>After compiling you get a bunch of <em>redis-*</em> files in your <em>src/</em> folder. Run <em>./src/redis-server</em> and it starts! Done!</p>

<p>Redis is often associated with caching, but that&#8217;s just one of its many, many uses. People sometimes call it a "swiss army knife", and that&#8217;s not a bad analogy.
As a low-level tool, it&#8217;s best seen as a one little program you can use to build a lot of cool stuff upon.</p>

<p>Even the basic datatypes become super useful when you have programs in written in different languages that want to work on the same data. Redis has clients for most languages and platforms.
(<a href="http://redis.io/clients">seriously</a>). And being fast, Redis actually fills the role of data migrator and interpreter nicely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Redis supports different data types, each with a slew of uses:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strings (basic key-value)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hashes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorted Sets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lists (Stacks, Queues)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publish / Subscribe (Message queue)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href="http://redis.io/commands">Redis commands</a> for the full, scary list of commands, grouped by data type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m way too lazy to try to summarize the different usecases, play around with them and you&#8217;ll probably get some ideas. Or try google.</p>

<p>A single-server, single-process Redis server does approximately 50 000 - 100 000 operations a second. This means that you can do 50 Redis operations per page load, and still have 1000 concurrent users. Obviously this is not Facebook or Google scale, but it&#8217;s more than enough for many, probably most, usecases. Scaling beyond this can be a little tricky, but there&#8217;s examples of people making it work.</p>

<p>Each of the data types supported by Redis has its usecases. Combine this with the cross-platform nature and ease of use, and you get something really useful.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s refreshingly little marketing-bs in the documentation and community. The documentation lists time complexity, in Big-O notation, for each command.
And, AFAIK, nobody pretends Redis is going to replace everything else and make RDBMS&#8217;s obsolete.</p>
