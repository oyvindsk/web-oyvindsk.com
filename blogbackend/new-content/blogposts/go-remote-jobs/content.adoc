[role="lead"]
Go (or golang) is a simple, general purpose programming language that excels at writing things like backend services. It's the language used to make Docker, among many other things.

I'm currently using Golang almost exclusively and I'm looking for remote freelance jobs. I've therefor compiled this list for my own sake,
but I guess it can be useful to others as well.

== Websites specifically for Golang

=== We Love Golang
link:http://www.welovegolang.com/jobs/search?q=remote[http://www.welovegolang.com/jobs/search?q=remote]

This is probably the site with the most Go specific listings. Many jobs in Europe and the US. It seems like searching for "remote" is not entirely reliable,
so double check the results before getting too excited about a job :). This site also has developer profiles, and you can get listed just by tweeting them.

=== Golangprojects.com
link:http://www.golangprojects.com/golang-remote-jobs.html[http://www.golangprojects.com/golang-remote-jobs.html]

Also a good place to find Go-specific job listings. This site also have developer profiles, but registering here is more work since they require more information.
Seems like most of the jobs are full time at the moment. Remote jobs can sometimes be US-specific.


== Websites specifically for remote jobs

=== RemoteOK
link:https://remoteok.io/remote-golang-jobs[https://remoteok.io/remote-golang-jobs]

Great site with reposts jobs from other places. You can often click the "Apply for job" to get to the website with the original listing.

=== Remotely Awesome Jobs
link:https://www.remotelyawesomejobs.com/tags/golang?q=[https://www.remotelyawesomejobs.com/tags/golang?q=]

Similar to the above, but fewer listings.

=== FlexJobs.com
link:https://www.flexjobs.com/search?search=golang&amp;location=[https://www.flexjobs.com/search?search=golang&amp;location=]

Remote / telecommute jobs site.


=== Jobspresso
link:https://jobspresso.co/browsejobs/#s=1[https://jobspresso.co/browsejobs/#s=1]

There's a couple of listings here, try searching for "golang" or maybe "go".



== Golang Forums etc

=== Gophers Slack channel
link:https://gophers.slack.com/messages/golang-jobs/[https://gophers.slack.com/messages/golang-jobs/]

The Gophers Slack is quite active and has a separate "Jobs" channel.


=== The Golang forum
link:https://forum.golangbridge.org/c/jobs[https://forum.golangbridge.org/c/jobs]



=== The Golang-Jobs Google+ Community
link:https://plus.google.com/communities/116819843904802051830[https://plus.google.com/communities/116819843904802051830]

Not super active, 2 postings in the four first months of 2016.


=== Hacker News Monthly Postings
link:http://hnhiring.me/[http://hnhiring.me/]

Hacker News has monthly "Ask HN: Who is hiring?" posts. This is an easy interface view and search this posts, you can filter on words etc.
More geeky than most job listing sites =)


== General job listing sites

=== Angel List
Startup jobs in the US and a few other places around the world. (No search function?)

Remote Jobs at Angel List:
link:https://angel.co/job-collections/remote[https://angel.co/job-collections/remote]


Golang  jobs at Angel List. Varies how much these emphasize Go.

=== Stack Overflow Jobs

// this failes because of the [] and Asciidoc does not allow &rbrack; or asciidoctor extention
Remote jobs tagged with golang: http:// stackoverflow.com/jobs?searchTerm=[golang]&allowsremote=true

//link:http://stackoverflow.com/jobs?searchTerm=&lbrack;golang&rbrack;&amp;allowsremote=true[http://stackoverflow.com/jobs?searchTerm=&lbrack;golang&rbrack;&amp;allowsremote=true]

Remote jobs containing the word "golang": link:https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?searchTerm=golang&allowsremote=true[https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?searchTerm=golang&allowsremote=true]

=== Monster.com
I was supriesd to find a few hits for "golang" and "remote" on Monster.com: link:http://jobs.monster.com/search/?q=golang&amp;where=remote[http://jobs.monster.com/search/?q=golang&amp;where=remote]


== Others checked

*link:https://remotecoder.io/[Remotecoder.io]*

No Go jobs when I checked.


*link:https://weworkremotely.com/jobs/search?term=golang[WeWorkRemotely.com]* 

No Go jobs when I checked.


*link:http://www.workingnomads.co/[Working Nomads]*

No Go jobs when I checked.


*link:https://www.wfh.io/categories/1-remote-software-development/jobs[Whf.io]*

Hard to know for sure, but I could not find any Go jobs when I checked.


*link:http://jobs.arcticstartup.com/[Job listings at Artic Startup]*

Startups in the nordics. No Go jobs when I checked.


*link:https://www.toptal.com/[Toptal]*

"Exclusive" site for freelancers. Don't know if there's demand for Go programmers here, they don't list their openings.
Last I checked (in 2014?) the onboarding process was very automated and not that great.
You could not do it in Go, but maybe that has changed.

A collection of the best resources for remote workers.
