<p>Lately the Docker project has grown to include many different projects, but the core is still the docker server and client. The client and server is contained in the same binary and written in Go (golang). This is the binary we&#8217;ll compile from source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Docker is pretty easy to install from binaries. They release pre-compiled binaries, an install script and many linux distros have packages ready to install.
So why would you want to build it from source? Well, I personally have two reasons: 1) I&#8217;m currently tinkering with Docker Plugins, a feature under development, and even the experimental build is lagging behind the latest developments. 2) Being able to modify the source and run the result can be very helpful when trying to understand how Docker works.</p>

<h2 id="_how">How</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out there are basically two ways of building docker from source: The hard way and the easy way. The hard way is to install all the dependencies and build everything from scratch. Although this is not that hard, docker has more dependencies than expected. The easy way is to use their build scripts to automate everything. This saves you all the trouble of finding and installing the right dependencies. The scripts builds and runs a docker image to compile the binary. So you need to have docker installed already to build docker in this way, which is the drawback.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being lazy, I&#8217;m going to go with the easy way, but if you want to this the hard way (without using docker) <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/Dockerfile">this Dockerfile</a> is a good starting point. From that you can extract all the dependencies and steps necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The easy way is roughly:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Install docker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the docker source</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the included scripts to create the docker image and compile everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test the binaries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the binaries to wherever you want to have them.</p>

</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ve had some issues with compiling docker on the smallest Digital Ocean plan. I think it&#8217;s because it runs out of ram and does not have any swap space to fall back to. You can fix this, I think, by creating and enabling some swap space:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Dockerfile and supporting scripts make it pretty easy to compile a new docker from source, they do all the heavy lifting for you.
This works by first building a new docker image from <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/Dockerfile">the Dockerfile</a>,
running this image and compiling a new docker binary.
Since it&#8217;s building a new docker image, the docker server (docker -d) must be running. Hence the need for installing docker first.
This docker image then has all the dependencies necessary to build docker from source. The docker binary is build inside this container and copied out afterwards.
Ideally the included Makefile and scrips do all of this for us, and produce a binary ready to use:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"># as root (or prepend with sudo)
make build
# this takes a while and prints the output from "Docker build ."
# It ends with: "Successfully built ..".

# as root (or prepend with sudo)
make binary

# This runs the image we created with "make build".
# Ends with "Created binary: bundles/1.8.0-dev/binary/docker-1.8.0-dev",
# where "1.8.0-dev" is the version I'm building,
# the next unreleased version at the time of writing.</code></pre>

<p>As you can see "Client version" and "Server version" are different. This is expected since the server is the new binary we just started as a daemon (./bundles&#8230;&#8203;docker -d).
The client, however, is the docker installed on the system. Run <em>which docker</em> to see where this binary is located.</p>
