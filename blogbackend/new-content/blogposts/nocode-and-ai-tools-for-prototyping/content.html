<p>I&#8217;m currently trying out lots of different No-code and AI tools to create mobile
and web apps. The goal is to be able to make prototypes and MVP&#8217;s much faster
and cheaper.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Startups and others who want to create something new are often faced with a
dilemma: They would like to create an app of some sort to test their idea and to
have something to show off.<br>
But, unless you are a developer and designer, it can
quickly cost a at least a few hundrede thousand dollars. And even if you can do
it yourself, it takes a long time to create things "from scratch".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All these tools have disadvantages. But given that the advantages are so great,
I think it can be a good solution for many.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Create something quick and cheap. Do it yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: There&#8217;s still a lot to learn. The result <em>could</em> be worse. Many different
tools, with their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a developer, I enjoy programming. But I also like to make things, with or without coding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I&#8217;m testing many of these tools and platforms and will share my experiences here</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_criteria">Criteria</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I look for tools that are useful for me and my clients. That is, they can help create apps of various kinds, for startups and the like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More specialized tools are interesting if they help create things that
entrepreneurs often want to create. E.g. with Sharetribe you can create a
marketplaces, where some sell and others buy, and that is something many people
want to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several things disqualify many tools at straight away:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Price: Either too expensive for a typical startup project or high price per end user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designed for large companies and their needs. Often related to price, but also what these tools are good and bad at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specialized in the "wrong" niche. E.g. there are many tools for creating web forms and glorified spreadsheets (A la Airtable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too difficult to test out or to get started with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Made for developers, for faster development, but requires programming.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While things that are a pluss, and the generalist tools should have:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Storage of data (some kind of database)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logic required to create apps (If A then B..)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many users: Support for creating a user, logging in etc (authentication)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many users: Not everyone has access to the same things (authorization)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for creating apps for mobile (native iOS / Android, and/or progressive web apps)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the list of the ones I will test. Did I forget any? Anyone have experience with one or more of these?</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="_generalist_all_purpose_platforms">Generalist, "all purpose" platforms</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_adalo"><a href="https://www.adalo.com/">Adalo</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Platform for creating web apps and mobile apps. I used Adalo about 4 years ago to make a prototype. Quite liked it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: From 0$ to 200$ per month. The most relevant plan costs 30$ per month, lets you use your own domain etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_bravo_studio"><a href="https://www.bravostudio.app">Bravo Studio</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From Figma design to a native mobile app.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: From 0$ per to 118$ per month. The 2 most relevant plans costs 21$ and
118$ per month. The expensive one is required to remove the Bravo logo/branding.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_bubble"><a href="https://bubble.io/">Bubble</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the oldest and best-known platforms for creating web apps. I tried it out
about 4 years ago, with somewhat mixed results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: From 0$ to 399$ per month. The most relevant plan costs 32$ per month, lets you use your own domain etc..</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_budibase"><a href="https://budibase.com">Budibase</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: 5$ per user per month?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_flutterflow"><a href="https://flutterflow.io/">FlutterFlow</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: 0 - 70$ per month.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_glide"><a href="https://glideapps.com/">Glide</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Possibly a bit too "enterprisy" for my use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: 2 price models: "For Makers" and "For companies". Maker is probably the
most relevant and costs 60$ per month (?). Although it seems like it has fewer
data sources than the "for companies" one.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_google_appsheet"><a href="https://about.appsheet.com/home/">Google Appsheet</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looks pretty versatile. Probably good integration with the rest of Google Workspace (Google Docs etc). Maybe a little limited?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: A bit unclear. 10$ per user per month? More if you want AI integration? Some of it included a Google Workspace subscription?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_jetadmin"><a href="https://www.jetadmin.io/">jetAdmin</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: From 49$ per month, 349$ to use your own domain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_plasmic"><a href="https://www.plasmic.app/">Plasmic</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source. Mostly focused on design and visuals. Maybe a little too simple?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: From 0$ to 499$. The most relevant plan, to remove the Plasmic logo, costs $49 per month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source, so you can use it for free, with all functionality etc?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_toddle_dev"><a href="https://toddle.dev">toddle.dev</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quite new. Norwegian? Danish?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: Actually looks quite cheap, but what does 20$ per user mean?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_weweb"><a href="https://weweb.io">WeWeb</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WeWeb is a "front end builder" that is used with another back-end solution of
some kind. For me it would perhaps be appropriate to code a back-end myself. But
there are also pure no-code back-end solutions such as Xano. Maybe <a href="https://pocketbase.io/">Pocketbase</a> could work as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: From 0$ to 179$ per month. 49$ per month to use your own domain. 179$ for more advanced functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plus the price of a back-end system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_wized"><a href="https://www.wized.com">Wized</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wized works together with Webflow to let you make more advanced websites and web
apps than you can with Webflow alone. Looks good. Perhaps most relevant if you
already know Webflow?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: From 0$ to 169$ per month. 12$ per month to use your own domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plus you have to pay for Webflow in addition?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_xano"><a href="https://www.xano.com">Xano</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Xano is a little different because it is only a backend system. Most no-code
tools have both a "front end" and a "back end" that work together. This means
that Xano alone is not enough, and must be used together with e.g. WeWeb.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Personally, I would have tested <a href="https://pocketbase.io/">Pocketbase</a>
at the same time as Xano, since it is open source and setting up a small server is something I&#8217;m comfortable with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: From 0$ to 225$ per month. The most relevant plan costs $99, but I think you can go a long way with the free plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plus the price of a front-end system.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_specialized">Specialized</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_sharetribe"><a href="https://www.sharetribe.com/">Sharetribe</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A platform for creating marketplaces, that is, a place where someone sells
something and someone buys. Such as Craigslist and Airbnb. But you can also sell
for example something by the hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: From 29$ to 249$ per month.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_figma_plugin_for_generating_code"><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/842128343887142055/figma-to-code-html-tailwind-flutter-swiftui">Figma plugin for generating code</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Figma to Code" is a plugin for the design tool Figma. It is one of many such
tools for creating code from designs in Figma. Supports html and css (with
Tailwind), Flutter and SwiftUI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alone, this is not a "no-code" tool. But there are several AI tools that support creating designs in Figma for you (see below).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: Appears to be free to use and <a href="https://github.com/bernaferrari/FigmaToCode">Open source</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_generative_ai">Generative AI</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are a little different. With the exception of Buzzy, they typically only
create a design (UI) and perhaps code to implement the design (html and css).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You cannot create a full web app or mobile app in most of these tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But using generative AI can save us so much time that it&#8217;s worth testing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m guessing the UI&#8217;s most of these create are pretty generic, and not as good
as a good designer could have made. So they may not be good enough if your app
is to stand out from the crowd with especially good design and UI.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_buzzy"><a href="https://www.buzzy.buzz/">Buzzy</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looks good, certainly one of the most promising on this list. When using chat (a
text description), it creates a UI for you. After giving you a change to change
the UI in Figma, Buzzy should in theory be able to create a working web or
mobile app.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Buzzy is one of the few AI/AI tools that does more than create a design and/or html and css.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: Not entirely obvious, but it seems that you can now pay 50$ per month to
generate UI (and code?). Whereas if you want them to "host" the web app (make it
available to users) it costs $600 for a year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No free trial.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href="https://www.buzzy.buzz/special-offers">"Special offers"</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_galileo"><a href="https://www.usegalileo.ai">Galileo</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When using chat (a text description), it creates a UI for you. The result is a
design in Figma. Unsure if it can also create code to implement the design. If
not, you can probably use the Figma plugin mentioned above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: 19$ per month, but everyone can see what you create. 39$ for "private mode".</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_rendition"><a href="https://tryrendition.com">Rendition</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rendition is actually two different things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://renditioncreate.com/">Rendition Create</a>: Create a design based on chat and either export it to Figma or create code to implement it (html and css with Tailwind).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1031998871372194709/Rendition%3A-Figma-%3EReact-in-one-click">Rendition from Figma</a>:
Take a design in Figma and create code to implement it (html and css with Tailwind). (Could not get this work last time I tried).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can test it for free.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Renedition Create: Not sure, 10$ per month?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rendition form Figma: Free to use a bit, then 10$ per month for more use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_uizard"><a href="https://uizard.io">Uizard</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generate design and UI with chat or from a screenshot or wireframe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Can also create some code (html, css and React code).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seems to have a lot of functionality for creating and editing UIs. So it&#8217;s also a simpler alternative to Figma.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: From 0$ to 49$ per month.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_vercel_v0"><a href="https://v0.dev/">Vercel v0</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vercel v0 is similar to Galileo. When using chat (a text description), it
creates a UI for you. v0 creates code to implement the design (html, css with
Tailwind and React).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>v0 cannot export to Figma and is perhaps more "tied" to React than the other similar tools?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Price: From 0$ per month, but everyone can see what you create. For $20 per
month you get to enjoy what it makes and also "High Quality", whatever that
means.</p>
</div>

Very curious about Appfarm and want to check it out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But in general it is probably too expensive for my use, typically 1000-2000$ per month, if I understood it correctly.</p>
