<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Øyvind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>I build fast, scalable and secure backend systems for startups and scaleups</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I work as an independent consultant, developer and architect, and I&#8217;m based in Oslo, Norway.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve taken contract work since 2014 and worked on 13 projects for 11 different clients. Some of these have been multi-year, full time contracts while others have been advisory roles or short-time projects. Most of my customers are startups or scaleups.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More about my previous clients can be found under <a href="https://oyvindsk.com/projects">Projects &amp; Clients</a> and in my full <a href="https://oyvindsk.com/cv/cv-øyvind_gerrard_skaar-english.pdf">CV in English (PDF)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I adjust my approach to each project based on the client and the project itself. When building backend systems from scratch I usually do it with Go and Google Cloud Platform. I feel I can focuse more on business objectives and actually building things by not switching technologies too often.</p>
