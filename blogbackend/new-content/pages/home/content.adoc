Hi, I'm Øyvind. I'm an independent consultant, developer and architect, based in Oslo, Norway.

I've taken contract work since 2014 and worked on 10 projects for 7 different clients. Some of these have been multi-year, full time contracts while others have been advisory roles or short-time projects.

These days I only work on projects using Go and/or Google Cloud Platform (but not for the reasons you think ;).

I also write about backend architecture, Go, Google Cloud Platform and related topics:
