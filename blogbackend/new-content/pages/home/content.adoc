Hi, I'm Øyvind. I'm an independent consultant, developer and architect, based in Oslo, Norway.

I've taken contract work since 2014 and worked on quite a few projects for different clients. Some of these have been multi-year, full time contracts while others have been advisory roles or short-time projects.

More about my previous clients can be found under link:https://oyvindsk.com/projects[Projects & Clients] and in my full link:https://oyvindsk.com/cv/cv-øyvind_gerrard_skaar-english.pdf[CV in English (PDF)]

These days I usually work on projects using Go and/or Google Cloud Platform. I feel I can focuse more on business objectives and actually building things by not switching technologies too often.
