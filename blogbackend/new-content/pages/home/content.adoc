Hi, I'm Øyvind. 

*I build fast, scalable and secure backend systems for startups and scaleups*.

I work as an independent consultant, developer and architect, and I'm based in Oslo, Norway.

I've taken contract work since 2014 and worked on 13 projects for 11 different clients. Some of these have been multi-year, full time contracts while others have been advisory roles or short-time projects. Most of my customers are startups or scaleups.

More about my previous clients can be found under link:https://oyvindsk.com/projects[Projects & Clients] and in my full link:https://oyvindsk.com/cv/cv-øyvind_gerrard_skaar-english.pdf[CV in English (PDF)]

I adjust my approach to each project based on the client and the project itself. When building backend systems from scratch I usually do it with Go and Google Cloud Platform. I feel I can focuse more on business objectives and actually building things by not switching technologies too often.
