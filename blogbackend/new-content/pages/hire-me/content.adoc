[role=lead]
Hi, I'm Øyvind. I'm a freelance developer and IT consultant based in Oslo, Norway.

[role=lead]
I am *currently looking for new projects*. See <<availability>> for the details. 

== What I can help you with
Are you working on building something new? Or maybe improving your existing back-end system? Do things move slower than necessary because you don't have enough programmers?

Or maybe things are slow and you're looking to speed it up with newer technologies and smarter solutions?

My specialty is back-end, server-side technology and architecture. I help build scalable and fast cloud-based systems.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you are unsure of what kind of developer you need for your project. If I can't help you myself I can at least steer you in the right direction. I've also gotten to know may other freelancers, independent consultants and designers. link:https://oyvindsk.com/contact[Just give me a call or fill out this form].

For examples of what I've done my clients in the past, see link:https://oyvindsk.com/projects[past clients and projects].

== How I preffer to work
I strongly prefer simplicity and strive for it whenever possible. 


=== Technology

My current language of choice is link:http://golang.org[Go (golang)] and I build systems on the link:http://cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Platform]. 

To be honest, I do not think choosing the "right" technology is very important. Usually, there are many that will do the trick and there are many ways to get the job done. There are, of course, exceptions. But for most projects choosing one technology over another does not give any great advantages. 

It is much more important to know your tools and their strengths and weaknesses. That's what I'm achieving by sticking with a few selected technologies. So while it's fun to learn new things and tempting to jump on the latest fashions, it can be harmful to productivity and the goals of the business footnote:[The customer does not care what programming language you use or if your running Istio or not. They _might_ care how often you deploy].  I try to counteract this by trying new things on my own time. 

Other, important are things, are:

* Finding the right balance between simplicity and sophistication in you architectures
* Understanding the larger picture. What are we making and why?
* Understanding the priorities of the business. Is 99.99% uptime critical?  Time-to-market? Or maybe giving yourselvs many chances of succeeding by saving money and taking sane shortcuts.

Having said that, there are reasons I choose to work with Go and the Google Cloud Platform. I like Go, both the simplicity of the language and the culture of pragmatism. It's a language very well suited for building back-end servers. Google Cloud Platform also has its strengths. I've always been a fan of their first platform-as-a-service, App Engine. They also seem to have a even stronger focus on pay-for-what-you-use than other cloud providers. 

I have experience with many different technologies and programming languages. Especially on the back-end. And, of course, I also know "adjacent" tools used by modern cloud-native deployments, such as: 
link:http://docker.com[Docker], 
link:https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes], 
link:http://git-scm.com[Git] and CI/CD systems. 
I've worked with severeal databases and datastores, mainly the Google Cloud native ones:  
link:https://cloud.google.com/firestore[Datastore / Firestore], 
link:https://cloud.google.com/storage[Storage] and 
link:https://cloud.google.com/sql[Cloud SQL]. Outside of GCP I've used  
link:https://www.mysql.com/[MySQL / MariaDB] extensivly,  
link:https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL], 
link:https://redis.io/[Redis] and 
link:https://sqlite.org[SQLite]. Lately I've taken an interest in graph databases, especailly link:https://dgraph.io[Dgraph].

Other past experice includes:
link:http://digitalocean.com[several]
link:http://zetta.io[cloud]
link:http://aws.amazon.com[providers] and languages such as
link:http://python.org[Python]
link:http://djangoproject.com[(w/ Django)],
link:http://www.perl.org[Perl 5]
link:http://mojolicio.us[(w/ Mojolicious)],
link:http://php.net[PHP] and
link:http://ruby-lang.org[Ruby]
link:http://rubyonrails.org/[(w/ Rails)],
as well as databases etc. 


== Background
After finishing my MSc in Informatics in 2010 I worked as a back-end developer, and "devops" guy for almost 4 years before I started my own company in 2014. Since then I’ve taken contract work and worked on 10 projects for 7 different clients. Some of these have been multi-year, full time contracts while others have been advisory roles or short-time projects.

For examples of what I've done my clients in the past, see link:https://oyvindsk.com/projects[past clients and projects].
