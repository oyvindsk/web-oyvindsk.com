[role=lead]
Hi, I'm Øyvind. I'm a freelance developer and IT consultant based in Oslo, Norway.

[role=lead]
I am: *currently looking for new projects*. See <<availability>> for the details. 


* link:http://www.linkedin.com/in/oskaar[LinkedIn] / link:https://oyvindsk.com/cv/cv-%C3%B8yvind_gerrard_skaar-english.pdf[CV]

I only work on projects using Go and/or Google Cloud Platform. This is _not_ because I believe they are strictly superior, or even that the choice of technology is very important for most projects. 



== Need additional Golang resources?

=== What I can help you with
Are you working on building something new? Or maybe improving your existing back-end system? Do things move slower than necessary because you have to few programmers?
Money is lost when features have to be postponed and the bugs that annoy your customers are not fixed. 
    
Or maybe things are slow and you're looking to speed it up with newer technologies and smarter solutions?

I help build distributed, scalable and fast back-end systems. I strongly prefer simplicity and strive for it whenever possible. My current language of choice is Golang and I build systems on the Google Cloud Platform.

=== Background
After finishing my MSc in Informatics in 2010 I worked as a back-end developer, and "devops" guy for almost 4 years before I started my own company in 2014.

I have experience with many different technologies and programming languages, especially on the back-end. But now I'm focusing on just Go and the Google Cloud Platform.
