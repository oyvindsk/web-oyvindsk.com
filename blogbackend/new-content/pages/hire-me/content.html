<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Are you working on building something new? Or maybe improving your existing back-end system? Is it slow? Or simply more costly than it needs to be?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do you lose customers and revenue because don&#8217;t have enough programmers?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My specialty is back-end, server-side technology and architecture. I help startups and scaleups build and scale cloud-based systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me if you are unsure of what kind of developer you need for your project. If I can&#8217;t help you myself I can at least steer you in the right direction. I&#8217;ve also gotten to know may other freelancers, independent consultants and designers. <a href="https://oyvindsk.com/contact">Just give me a call or fill out this form</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_how_i_prefer_to_work">How I prefer to work</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I strongly prefer simplicity and strive for it whenever possible. Especially when working with startups, where speed of development and change is very important.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_technology">Technology</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My current language of choice is <a href="http://golang.org">Go (golang)</a> and I build systems on the <a href="http://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be honest, I do not think choosing the "right" technology is very important. Usually, there are many that will do the trick and there are many ways to get the job done. There are, of course, exceptions. But for most projects choosing one technology over another does not give any great advantages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is much more important to know your tools and their strengths and weaknesses. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m achieving by sticking with a few selected technologies. So while it&#8217;s fun to learn new things and tempting to jump on the latest fashions, it can be harmful to productivity and the goals of the business <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.  I try to counteract this by trying new things on my own time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other, important are things, are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finding the right balance between simplicity and sophistication in you architectures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding the larger picture. What are we making and why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding the priorities of the business. Is 99.99% uptime critical?  Time-to-market? Or maybe giving yourselves many chances of succeeding by saving money and taking sane shortcuts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having said that, there are reasons I choose to work with Go and the Google Cloud Platform. I like Go, both the simplicity of the language and the culture of pragmatism. It&#8217;s a language very well suited for building back-end servers. Google Cloud Platform also has its strengths. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of their first platform-as-a-service, App Engine, and Cloud Run They also seem to have a even stronger focus on pay-for-what-you-use than other cloud providers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have experience with many different technologies and programming languages. Especially on the back-end. And, of course, I also know "adjacent" tools used by modern cloud-native deployments, such as:
<a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a>,
<a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a>,
<a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> and CI/CD systems.
I&#8217;ve worked with several databases and datastores, both the Google Cloud native ones:
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore">Datastore / Firestore</a>,
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage">Storage</a> and
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql">Cloud SQL</a>. Outside of GCP I&#8217;ve used
<a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL / MariaDB</a> and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> extensively, as well as others such as
<a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>,
<a href="https://sqlite.org">SQLite</a> and <a href="https://arangodb.com/">ArangoDB</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other past experience includes:
<a href="http://digitalocean.com">several</a>
<a href="http://zetta.io">cloud</a>
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com">providers</a> and languages such as
<a href="http://python.org">Python</a>
<a href="http://djangoproject.com">(w/ Django)</a>,
<a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl 5</a>
<a href="http://mojolicio.us">(w/ Mojolicious)</a>,
<a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> and
<a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>
<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">(w/ Rails)</a>,
as well as databases etc.</p>
