Hi, I'm Øyvind. I'm a freelance developer and IT consultant based in Oslo, Norway.
I'm an independent consultant, developer and architect, working with Google Cloud technologies and Go (golang). 

After studying computer science and working for a few years, I left my job in 2014 to start my own company and work as a freelancer and independent consultant.
I've done quite a few things since then.
Primarily, I've worked with startups and other innovative companies that use newer technologies and have a knack for creative, pragmatic solutions.

Having worked with startups in the past, I'm well-versed in on open source software and cloud deployments.
My specialty is back-end, server-side technology and architecture. 

Now it's all link:http://golang.org[Go (golang)] and link:http://cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Platform] but previous technologies include:
