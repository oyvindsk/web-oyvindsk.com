<div class="paragraph">
<p>MVP Monkey was my foray into a different customer segment and a new business model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea was to help founders and early stage startups to get "unstuck" from the situation where they need a product but can&#8217;t get funding without a product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spending a month or two to build a quick, but working, app is also a better way to validate ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By using NoCode and AI tools, I could create web and mobile apps much quicker and cheaper.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To speed up development I did a few things very differently:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Use all the new No-Code and AI tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with the founder to get to the core idea and Value Proposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of building all imaginable features, we built only what was needed to get traction and test the idea (underlying hypothesis).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_results">Results</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MVP Monkey never got enough traction, so I shut it down. Basically, it was too hard to find anyone who wanted to buy the services.</p>

<h4 id="_what_i_learned">What I learned</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Validating ideas without selling something is very hard (well, I already knew that, but still)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Preceding the more complete MVP I created a couple of prototypes using No-Code tools. The first take was to use Bubble to create a semi-working web app, mostly to explore user signup and job creation. After hitting some problems, I switched to Adalo and created a more mobile-friendly prototype.</p>

<p>I worked with a freelance designer to build a prototype of the web-based platform. She did design, html and css. I wrote the backend, converted her HTML into templates, created data models and deployed the application.</p>

<p>Functionality:
User signup and login, job registration and listing. Automatic matching (sorting) of jobs based on the user preferences.</p>

<p>Fantasy Football League (FFL) was a fantasy-football (soccer) mobile app. It had several new features and innovative game-play to set it apart from its competitors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We worked in a small team of 3 people. The 2 others were the customer who set the overall direction and was the domain expert, and one developer who made the iPhone app</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I made the backend system, which contained:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Go program that contained the game logic and exposed an API to the iOS client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrations with third parties, mostly real-time information about football matches, players, goals, substitutes etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database for storing simple things like customer information, but also complex schema&#8217;s for making a real-time "view" of the real world (PostgreSQL).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Servers to run the integrations, game logic and REST API. In this case a manged PaaS (Google Cloud Run), so there was little "devops".</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was a fun project with fast development, great teamwork and exiting technical challenges. Unfortunately, we developers were needed on other projects after finishing the beta. The development continued, but it never gained enough traction, and the app was later discontinued.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_challenges">Challenges</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real time synchronization: Unlike the competitors, FFL allowed substitutions while the game was in play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complicated logic and rules for the game-play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anti cheats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Novel and innovative game-play meant a lot of trial-and-error development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre Product-Market-Fit</p>

<li>
<p>Very fast development of new features</p>

<p>The development and technical aspects was a great success.  We created a fast, easy-to-use app, with novel game-play and real-time attributes, in record time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, FFL never found product-market-fit. My opinion, and I believe the customer would agree, is that not enough effort was put into marketing and customer research.</p>

<p>The workflow used by Intolife before this project was based on Excel and manual data input. This worked fine. But it was time-consuming and limited the possibilities for interacting with third parties.  With this project we created a fully customized web-based application (so called Software as a Service, or Saas) for Intolife. The goals were to cut down the time required for data entry and to automatically generate reports.  We also wanted to allow for future expansion and integration with other software and services.
We developed this project using  lean startup methodologies. This gave us more flexibility. It also saved money by avoiding the development of unnecessary features.</p>

<p>The result is a web-based application that helps with data-input and report generation. This helped Intolife use approximately 50% less time on each of their projects. The application is used mainly by Intolife, but it&#8217;s also open to other partners and customers. It generates reports with 1 click. Since flexibility is important, we develop the software in phases, with their own milestones. This made  it possible to quickly incorporate the lessons learned during development into the project.  We meet the short-term needs while keeping the software open for future development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The software also laid the groundwork for future expansions, and was later expanded with a REST API. This made it possible to automatically communicate with other systems. Examples are the customer&#8217;s systems and third party systems.</p>

<h4 id="_project_background">Project background</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We launched this project to make it possible to integrate the <em>Intolife web application</em> with third parties. These third parties are typically customers and partners. They can use the API to include  waste and emission data (GHG) in their own software and appliances. Using the API they can get this data automatically, without human interaction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_results_6">Results</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The API was completed and deployed to production on Google Cloud.
For years It was used by IntoLife customers daily and opened up for many new possibilities.
Use-cases that would otherwise involve too much human labor was made quick and easy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_we_learned_2">What we learned</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Moving forward in the face of uncertainty.</strong> This project faced some challenges that are in many ways quite typical for startup projects. The first of these is the question of exactly what we are making. We had a good sense of where we were heading and why. But neither we or Intolife&#8217;s customers and partners had a concrete case in mind. We were treading new ground and the customers do not always know exactly what they want until they see it. This led to a "catch-22" situation. We needed to show something for people to understand the use-case. But, at the same time we needed customer feedback to make it in the first place. There&#8217;s no easy, magical solution to this. The way through seems to be to learn as much as possible while spending as little time and money as possible. In this case we implemented a first version of the API in cooperation with one of the customers. We will use this first version to get feedback and drive customer engagement. Improve and iterate, or <code>build measure learn</code> as Eric Ries puts it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Extending an existing system does not have to be hard.</strong> There was also a perceived challenge to fit this new API "on top" of the existing code and data model. Although it&#8217;s certainly easier to start with a clean slate, this turned out to be quite manageable. The web application was made in a way that makes it easy to extend. The right level of flexibility and fairly clean and  commented code makes this possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Writing documentation is time-consuming.</strong> The time and effort needed to write good API documentation surprised me. It was worth it though, as having this is crucial for adaptation of the API. I&#8217;ve previously experienced how missing or lacking documentation can make it unnecessary difficult to implement external APIs.</p>

<p>Picturus is a medical app designed to diagnose Jaundice in newborns. Untreated jaundice in newborns is responsible for 114,000 deaths and 65,000 permanent brain damages each year. More than three quarters of these deaths occur in the poorest regions of the world, in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Cheap treatment is available through e.g. sunlight, but the diagnostic devices in use today cost around 10,000 dollars, making them practically unavailable in low-resource settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Picturus therefore developed a smartphone app capable of diagnosing this condition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a sub-contractor I developed a small part of the MVP for this app. With my specialty in back-end systems I created a REST API to support features in the app that relies on something outside the device (phone) itself.</p>

<p><code>A social media engagement platform for e-merchants</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shout out Referral is a referral system for web-shops that merges e-commerce with social media. It was a new project from individuals with success from other e-commerce ventures. They had a good idea and e-commerce experience. What they needed was someone with technical know-how and developer background to help them move forward from the idea phase.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_results_7">Results</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I helped draw up the technical architecture and the rest of the technology stack. After we figured out the core features, I implemented a simple prototype.
The purpose was twofold: 1) to explore the possibilities and limitations of different social media providers, and 2) to show off the idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We ended up with a simple, but working prototype. It shows off a typical use-case for the product. We explored the different social media providers. The merging of different technologies unveiled some unexpected results. Also, we learned that authenticating with many social media providers makes identity handling challenging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Developing a prototype taught us much and was worth the time and effort. It raised questions that should be raised sooner rather than later. There are also many assumptions made early on. These assumptions do not always hold when theory meets real life. So it’s important to check these assumptions as early as possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_we_learned_3">What we learned</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project depends heavily on social media integrations. We soon discovered that not all the providers have equally good APIs. Also, the different providers have different policies and guidelines. Since these factors are outside our control, these limitations can not be "fixed". We must work around them. The advantage of following lean practices are clear here. We discovered these limitations early in the process, before wasting time on creating the wrong plans and unneeded code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using new technology can be unpredictable. There can be hidden advantages and disadvantages. Hidden disadvantages are likely more common, the advantages are often well promoted. In making the prototype we used somewhat new and unknown technology. In particular, the open source OAuth / Oauth2 library for Golang did not support App Engine. I therefore had to modify it. This was unexpected and made developing the social media log-ins ten times as time-consuming as expected. However, more often than not, the advantages new technologies bring will be worth the effort.</p>

<p>I wrote it in Go and ran it on Googles App Engine Platform as a service (PaaS).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I really like the idea of PaaS, especially for projects that are going to grow big. I did feel the pain on working with App Engine though:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Code must be written for especially for App Engine (note: No longer true for App Engine and Cloud Run)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This, coupled with all the custom infrastructure really lock you in to App Engine, you can&#8217;t easily quit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steep learning curve</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many 3rd party packages do not work on the App Engine. It took me days, not minutes,  to get Facebook and Twitter integration to work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be expensive</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But let&#8217;s not forget the positives:
* Scales totally automatically and indefinitely (If you use it correctly). This is how people often think all clouds work, but that&#8217;s almost never the case. Especially for the database / nosql / datastore.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The cost scales linearly with what you use (if I&#8217;m reading the pricing correctly). Unlike Heroku, for example. This makes a lot of business sense in many cases. Start out free or very cheap and pay more as the usage grows. Often the growing usage and expenses means more paying customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google cloud has so many cool tools to play with. Some of them give you the power of thousands of servers and can thus take a heavy task from 10 minutes to 10 seconds.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like most of these projects it&#8217;s partly for the usefulness, partly for learning and partly for the fun of it. This project chats with an SMTP server to find out if an email address is actually in use (works surprisingly well).  Now, I&#8217;m planning to run a few million addresses through this, so even with go&#8217;s concurrency, it&#8217;s going to need more than 1 server. This is not going to be used for spam, I promise :). It has a REST API for submitting email addresses. It works, but it&#8217;s not finished.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_challenges_4">Challenges</h5>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoid getting blocked by smtp servers. Solution: Smart throttle and fan out to multiple machines (ip&#8217;s)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributing the work and gathering the results. I chose to use NSQ to communicate between the processes and machines. It&#8217;s a distributed message bus made by bit.ly. In terms of learning, it&#8217;s been great, I&#8217;ve learned a lot. But in retrospect, NSQ might be a little too "low level" for this project. Something like Resque/Sidekiq, Gearmand or one of the Go alternatives would have been <strong>much</strong> easier to work with. With a 1-way message bus like NSQ you are responsible for matching replies to requests, and other things a job system gives you for free. On the other hand NSQ does not have any single point of failures, it&#8217;s fast and you can just hook up new parts to the stream to get messages on the fly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How should the throttling work? Per source IP? Per email domain (@gmail.com)? Can we save time by not re-connecting to the same smtp server all the time? How much traffic can you send to a server before you create problems for them? Or before they block you?    Solution: Start simple and "slow". Gradually crank it up and incorporate what you learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running it in containers (Docker) changes things a little bit. The biggest reason to run it on multiple machines is to get many source ip&#8217;s. But with containers it could place all the workers on the same machine. It was tested in something called Rancher, which "fixes" this, but has a bug that complicates the NSQ deployment.</p>
